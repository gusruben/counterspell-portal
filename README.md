# Counterspell Portal

> Counterspell has ended! Thank you to everyone who used portal, it was really special to see other people from all over the world. Upload your memories and view others' at [portal.hackclub.com/gallery](https://portal.hackclub.com/gallery)!

**Counterspell Portal** was a way to connect [Counterspell](https://counterspell.hackclub.com/) events together. Counterspell was a game jam run in 50+ cities simultaneously in November 2014, and this project took dvantage of that by connecting events in real time. Counterspell Portal facilitates a live video feed between random events, shuffling every 15 minutes.

This project was partially inspired by the [NYC-Dublin Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York%E2%80%93Dublin_Portal), an art installation from March 2024 (though we're hoping for less controversy!)
